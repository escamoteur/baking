## Breadcrumbs are awesome
The nice thing about this receipe is that it shows you how to upcycle bread that got stale. Intead of throwing it away, drye and grind old bread to fine breadcrumbs. You can replace up to 20% of flour in bread recipes with breadcrumbs and it will make your bread tastier and it will stay longer fresh because bread crumbs help to bind water.

As with most breads we will use a starter for the dough that has to be prepared 12-20h before you want to bake.

## Starter

* Mix 100g wheat wholemeal flour with 100g bread crumbs, 240g water and 0,2g fresh yeast (about the size of two rice corns)
* let it ripe 12-20h (the longer the better) at 18-20°

## The dough

* combine the starter with 345g wheat flour type 1050, 135g rye flour type 1150, 205g water, 7g fresh yeast, 14g salt
* knead slow 8 minutes then 4 minutes fast
* let the dough rise 60 minutes at 24°
* form a round loaf and put it in a [proving basket](https://www.google.com/search?q=proofing+basket)
* let it rise another 60 minutes at 24°

** Sour dough variant **

* Mix 120g rye flour type 1150 with 100g bread crumbs, 275g water and 25g sour dough starter
* let it ripe 6-8h at 28-30° (alternative 20-22h at 20° which will create a more pronounced sour taste)

* combine the starter with 345g wheat flour type 1050, 100g wheat wholemeal flour, 165g water,  14g salt
* knead slow 8 minutes then 4 minutes fast
* let the dough rise 90 minutes at 28°
* form a round loaf and put it in a [proving basket](https://www.google.com/search?q=proofing+basket)
* let it rise another 90 minutes at 28°


## Baking 

* Preheat your oven to 250° for at least half an hour
* evert the basket onto a backing tray with baking paper
* make two crosswise deep cuts 
* put in the lower part of your oven 
* pour a small glass of water on the bottom of your oven and quickly close the lid

* reduce the heat to 200
* after 10 minutes, open the lid to let the steam out and continue baking for 40 minutes
