because of repeated requests for my bread and rolls that I post on Twitter I will try to publish my receipes on this repository.

All measurements are made in gramms, temperatures are in Celcius!
Flour types are German types, please google what's the appropriate type for your country

Rolls and breads can perfectly be frosted, so I typically always double the amount of the receipes. To unfrost rolls put them into your oven and set the oven to 190° convection heat. When the oven reaches the 190° the rolls will be perfect.

To unfrost bread it's best if you have a microwave that offers a combined microwave/convection baking function. With this set to 400W/200° for my device I get perfectly defrosted bread within 8 minutes. Bread detoriates most around 7° temperature so it's good to move it quickly over this range when frosting/defrosting.
