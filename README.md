because of repeated requests for my bread and rolls that I post on Twitter I will try to publish my receipes on this repository.

All measurements are made in gramms, temperatures are in Celcius!
Flour types are German types, please google what's the appropriate type for your country

Rolls and breads can perfectly be frosted, so I typically always double the amount of the receipes. To unfrost rolls put them into your oven and set the oven to 190째 convection heat. When the oven reaches the 190째 the rolls will be perfect.

To unfrost bread it's best if you have a microwave that offers a combined microwave/convection baking function. With this set to 400W/200째 for my device I get perfectly defrosted bread within 8 minutes. Bread detoriates most around 7째 temperature so it's good to move it quickly over this range when frosting/defrosting.

If you are a little experienced I you can increase the amount of water that is used a bit which will lead to even better results.

If you are looking for a mixer that is good for bread I can recomment Kenwood machines.

To get good baking results I recommend getting a baking stone that you preheat in your oven. The result will be much better as without.

I accept PRs for typos or translations of units :-)
