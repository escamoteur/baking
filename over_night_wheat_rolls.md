My favorite sunday rolls because you prepare them the night before and only bake them in the morning.

## In the evening 

* Mix 510g Wheat Flour Type 510 with 305g water (20°) and let it rest for 30 minutes (no kneading)

* Add 5g fresh yeast, 10g brown sugar, 10g butter, 10g salt
* knead slowly for 3 minutes then fast 5 minutes
* let rise for 60 minutes at 24°
* split the dough into 8-9 pieces a 92-95g and grind them first to round buns, then roll them longish with pointed ends
* put them between linen cloths so that they can't touch each other and let them rise overnight in your fridge at 4-6°

## In the morning

* preheat your oven to 250°
* put the rolls carefully on a baking tray and slice them at the side with a really sharp knife
* If you want spray them with a bit water and sprinkle coarse corn flower over it. 
* Put the tray into the middle of the oven and pour a small glass of water on the bottom of your oven and immediately close the lid.
* turn the head down to 210°

* bake for 15 minutes, then open the lid to let the steam out. close the lid but put a wooden spoon in between so that a small gap is created and bake for another 14 minutes
